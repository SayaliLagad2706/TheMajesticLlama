A single-page responsive we application has been created using Angular 7 framework. The page is currently static but can be used to display dynamic content from several APIs from server.js (a node file).
Various features like parallax scrolling, random circular pattern generation, html canvas, html cards, modal, etc. are implemented in this project.
Angular was chosen for this project because it allows easy creation of single page applications. This reduces the overhead of creating separate HTML pages and then linking them all together.
